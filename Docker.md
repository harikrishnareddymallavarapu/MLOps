### Docker

1. Docker is a platform used by developers and sysadmins to develop, deploy and run containarized applications
2. Containers are running process that encapsulates everything an application needs to run. It helps in shuffling the applications acrossdifferent OS without an impact on the application

Hypervisor - It is installed on the infrastructure \ Physical machine and manages the requests to the hardware.

VM based applications requires complete Guest OS to be deployed on the VM which is waste of resources. Container based applications do not require entire OS, they run in the application layer and share the resources of the Host OS and Kernel to run the appliation, they isolate the application and run.
